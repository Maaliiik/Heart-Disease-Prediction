# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The leading cause of death in the developed world is heart disease. Therefore there needs to be work done to help prevent the risks of of having a heart attack or stroke.
I Used this dataset to predict which patients are most likely to suffer from a heart disease in the near future using the features given.

This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
